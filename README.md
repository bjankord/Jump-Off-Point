Jump Off Point
==============

This collection of tools combine to form a boilplate that I use as a jumping off point for new projects.

So far this collection is made up of:

[HTML Boilerplate](https://github.com/bjankord/HTML-Boilerplate) - A simple HTML boilerplate

[CSS Coding Standards](https://github.com/bjankord/CSS-Coding-Standards) - Personal coding standards for crafting CSS

[CSS Modules Subcomponents And Modifiers Collection](https://github.com/bjankord/CSS-Modules-Subcomponents-And-Modifiers-Collection) - A collection of common CSS module class names.

[Base.css](https://github.com/bjankord/Base.css) - A group of base styles intended for use with progressive enhancement

[Utilities.css](https://github.com/bjankord/Utilities.css) - A collection of common utility styles

[Style Guide Boilerplate](https://github.com/bjankord/Style-Guide-Boilerplate) - A ready to use web style guide
